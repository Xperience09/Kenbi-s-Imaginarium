    title: "Responsibility",
    content: `I hear the sounds of duties near,

Pressing down, my heart in fear.
The weight is heavy—what can I do?

How can a child who never grew
Bear the load of life’s demands too?

In moments where chaos fills the air,
A smile emerges, soft and fair.
It cuts through shadows, bright and clear,
Dispelling all my deepest fear.
That smile—oh, that smile so true, so dear.

It tells me, “You're okay, you'll be fine.”
It whispers, “Let go of what’s not mine.”
It urges me to stand and grow,
And so, I breathe, I take it slow,
And find the strength to face tomorrow’s glow.`,

    title: "Giving Up",
    content: `How do I reconcile—  
Body and mind at odds, estranged,  
Each unwilling to yield or be changed.  
How should I feel when my own essence betrays,  
Incapable of calming the turmoil it portrays?  
Sharing seems a breach of sacred silence,  
And seeking aid—a hollow pretense.  

How do I persevere—  
Crushed beneath responsibilities’ weight,  
Feeling like a traitor to my own fate.  
My concern for others, boundless and true,  
Yet I feign strength, concealing the view.  
Is this the reality adults must endure,  
Or am I too young for such burdens to mature?  

How do I endure—  
Pleading with my mind to grant reprieve,  
“Not today, let me in tranquility believe.”  
“Not today, you must wear a facade,  
For the sake of others, despite the façade.”  
Will I ever find a day that’s mine,  
Where I can be genuine, and no longer confined?`,

    title: "AdultHood",
    content: `Where did the time go, where did it stray?
Yesterday, I was just a kid at play,
Dreams and sparks lit my youthful skies,
Now darkness closes in, no light to rise.

I look around, these creatures so fine,
Living their best lives, effortlessly divine.
They bask in beauty, their needs are met,
While I’m here begging for what they forget.

A drop of affection, a taste of the real,
Not just surviving, but something to feel.
Each day’s a cluster, a cruel, cold maze,
Rest won’t suffice in this endless haze.

Oh Lord, I need more than just a break,
Liberation from this human ache.`,

    title: "Rain",
    content: `I want to smile,  
With the rain tracing lines on my face,  
Erasing the sorrow, leaving no trace.

I want to laugh,  
With the rain echoing my joy,  
A dance of freedom, nothing to destroy.

I want to breathe,  
With the rain filling my lungs,  
A renewal of life where hope belongs.`,

    title: "Dream",
    content: `Been wandering ages for catharsis,  
The ambiance grows stronger, thick, and vast,  
Illecebrous souls surround me tight,  
Yet these selcouth thoughts, I cannot fight.

Dreaming of sonatas on my bare skin,  
A melody to drown the noise within.  
I shall whelve myself in depths unseen,  
Feeling forlorn in this endless dream.

Days blend in this immanence I chase,  
But is it real, or just a fleeting trace?`,

    title: "Untitled",
    content: `Each time something hurts, it’s a cruel refrain,  
We’re reminded of all the past pain,  
The entire ambiance comes flashing by,  
No blame to place, no reason why.

Emotions have their own way to flow,  
Let the pain engulf you, let it grow.  
Try, try each day, each fleeting hour,  
Till you can bear it no more, feel its power.

It’s okay to wound your own heart,  
Let the darkness nestle, let it start.  
Leave the world behind, it’s not a crime,  
No! You’re not a coward, not this time.

You are a beautiful, honest soul,  
Too pure for this world, too whole.  
Leaving behind what this world demands,  
Elevates you to a place where peace stands.`,

    title: "Untitled",
    content: `The rumination I go through nocturnally has led me to question my own existence;
How I toss and turn with the turmoil in my head
While the other side lies in deep, sweet slumber.
The way the world works is astonishing to my naked eyes—
How evil rests while the good remain restless.
It certainly doesn’t seem feasible to have a moment of respite.
Thus, I bewilder myself with the inquisition:
“Would I be gifted with a mind filled with tranquility and contentment, had I committed deeds of malice onto another?”
Then I wonder,
“Shall I ever be bestowed with peace?`,

    content: `And she said, “I’ve been dreaming a lot these days. It’s not just simple dreaming, but more like living in a reality. I feel the moments, the answers, the love, the adoration I crave—I’m living it all in my dreams. It’s becoming hard to distinguish between my dreams and my reality. I’m not going insane… am I?”

She paused for a moment, looked up at the sky, and continued,
“I’ve always hated dreams because I’m happy there, and I don’t like it. It feels like floating in a bubble of the life I’ve always desired—with all the people who loved me, all the moments I’ve been waiting for, all the good surprises I deserved.”

With a frown and a heavy heart, she walked away, a single tear rolling down her cheek.`,

    title: "Untitled",
    content: `How do I do this—  
Convincing my body and mind to unite,  
When they clash, refusing to fight.  
How can I feel when my own self betrays,  
Unable to soothe the thoughts it displays?  
Sharing feels like a breach of peace,  
And asking for help—a forced release.  

How do I do this—  
Overwhelmed by the weight each day,  
Feeling like a traitor just living this way.  
I care for others, my concern runs deep,  
Yet I fake my strength, while secrets I keep.  
Is this the life that adults face,  
Or am I too young, misplaced in this race?  

How do I do this—  
When I beg my mind to let me breathe,  
“Not today, please, let me believe.”  
“Not today, you must wear a smile,  
For others' sake, just for a while.”  
Will I ever have a day of my own,  
Where I can be real, not fighting alone?`,

    title: "Untitled",
    content: `Waking up feels like a war each dawn,  
Memories of strength, long faded, withdrawn.  
They say, "It gets better, just give it time,"  
So here I stand, waiting for a sign.  

My mind’s a maze where reason is lost,  
Trapped in solitude, paying the cost.  
The shadows, they gather, they feast on me,  
The night their kingdom, their decree.  

Voices whisper from the dark and cold,  
Urging me to let go, to lose my hold.  
But I see through their wicked disguise,  
I’m not so weak, I won’t compromise.  

Some nights, I hold the rope in my palm,  
Defying the demons, refusing their calm.  
Some days, I flirt with the edge of despair,  
Walking in places I shouldn’t dare.  

To be honest, life feels barren and bleak,  
A tree without fruit, no joy to seek.  
I don’t mean to sound bitter, don’t want to complain,  
But what do I do with a heart drowning in pain?  

I’ll keep fighting, though the battles are long,  
Hoping one day to reclaim my song.  
For now, I stand in this fragile state,  
Waiting, hoping, for a kinder fate.`,

    title: "Untitled",
    content: `A question lingers repeatedly in my mind,
One I am incapable of answering:
How does the world truly want me to be?
Can I be myself, or something more intriguing?

Is being me wearisome or wondrous?
I see all these people,
Living lives full of delightful moments,
While I remain a sheeple.

It’s hard to see beyond my own reflection,
To create new bonds and connections.
The fear of missing out holds me back,
Yet I’m not ready to lower my guard.`,

    content: `Mother! Your child is tired,
Nights full of thoughts,
Countless answers sought,
Demons and devils conspired.

It seems they care,
Until the moment you share.
They couldn’t handle the weight
When I said I was nearing my breaking state.

I had always looked up to you,
The fighter in you gave me a clue.
But mama, it’s quiet now,
I suppose, the end of all my doubts somehow.

You didn’t fail me, I swear—
Accept my apology, my prayer.
Your daughter feels undesired,
Mother! Your child is tired.`,

more of a laughter,
she watched from afar,
a breath of relief ran through her heart.

He was never this happy
when they were together.
All she ever wanted
was to see him truly happy,
deep down, in his heart.

—She saw him smiling that day.`,

They fell
Soft petals scattered 'round,  
On dry and barren ground—  
Empty days,  
Nights unaware, where loneliness found its lair.

They fell,
Gentle raindrops from the sky,  
Mystic grace they held inside,  
Spun in dance by winds that sighed.

They fell,
Yet bloomed once more,  
Casting rays of hope that soared,  
Warming hearts across the globe.

Gusts of solitude,  
Dusts of gratitude—  
They fell, on their own, they fell.`,

    content: `Rainy Nights

Drops of rain,
Bringing endless pain.

Turmoil in my head,
Wishing me dead.

I won’t run,
Not until comes the sun.

The weight of tiredness grows,
Or so, I suppose.

I bury my head under,
From the roar of thunder.

Frightened by the storm’s tether,
With no one to hold me together.

Drops of rain,
Brought endless pain.`,

    content: `In a world full of comparison,
Don’t lose yourself.
Weight can be managed,
Skin can be toned,
Teeth can be whitened,
A lover can be found,
Money can be earned.

Never compare yourself to others or belittle them just because they don’t have what you do. Eventually, everyone will have their own successes.

What others can’t replicate is your knowledge and humility—these are uniquely yours. So, invest in educating yourself before focusing on outer appearances.`,

    content: `Every love story is beautiful—
Some last, some don’t.
The most beautiful ones often end,
Leaving behind incomplete tales,
And souls scattered in pieces.

Every heart has felt,
Every heart has been wounded.
The strong survive,
The less strong fall apart.

Different kinds of stories,
Different kinds of beginnings,
Each with its own ending,
Each with its own kind of pain.

In the end, we’re all just surviving,
We’re all still trying.
Life is like a wedged flow—
But if we fix it,
It becomes plain and simple.`,

Instead, she chose death,
Leaving tears behind,
Leaving pain behind.

Her mother cried endlessly,
Her grief never ceased.
Her father tried to stay strong,
But wept quietly where he belonged.

Everyone now recalls
How sweet a soul she had,
Yet no one was truly sad.
They praised her life, her ways,
How well she had been raised.

Now that she’s gone,
People care, people love.
She became valuable the day she died—
Before that, no one tried.`,

    content: `Phase

As we grow older,
We see things more clearly.
The fun we once had
Always seemed to be fleeting.

Many mistakes were made,
Problems that made us shed tears.
We realize these were necessary
To later share our story with others.

Being young isn’t easy;
You’re always questioning.
But the boundaries we had
Were just protections we needed.

Whether young or old,
Speak your truth.
It’s just a phase,
And it shall pass.

Enjoy as much as you can,
Do what you still can.
For everything is a phase,
And it shall pass.`,

See beyond the surface and feel the struggles I carry within.
Recognize the silent battles I fight and the emotional scars that linger.
True connection comes from knowing the depths of my heart,
Not merely the external features that fade over time.
Understand my essence, and you’ll find the real me.`,

    content: `A child was born
in her most innocent form
she knew nothing about storm
her desires were pinned
which soon contradicted as sinned

She soon realized
the only thing she can do was cry
her life turned out dry
she wanted to fly high
but dropped it,with a sigh

Noone had she have
to show her wounds and ask to save
as the year grows
her wounds intimidatingly grows

The pains were bigger
the screams were louder
that deep weight on her heart
were signs of lessons she learnt
nothing was enough for living
and also she stopped believing.`,
